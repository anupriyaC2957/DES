# DES
The algorithm involves 16 rounds of encryption, with each round using a different key. Therefore, 16 keys are generated. In DES, 16 subkeys are generated from the initial 64-bit key. Each subkey is 48 bits long and unique for every round of encryption and decryption. This variation in keys for each round adds a layer of security to the algorithm, making it more resistant to attacks. These subkeys are derived using a process that involves permutation and rotation, ensuring a diverse set of keys for enhanced encryption strength.
